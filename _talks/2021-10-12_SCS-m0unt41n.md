In this presentation at the [Swiss Cyber Storm](https://www.swisscyberstorm.com/) conference in 2021, I talk about my experiences as team coach of the Swiss National Hacking Team for the [European Cyber Security Challenge 2021](https://ecsc.eu/). In particular, I discuss the team selection, training, and final competition. Furthermore, a team member gives a quick glance into a challenging heap exploitation challenge that our team solved during preparation.
