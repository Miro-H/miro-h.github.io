short_desc: We present a formal syntax and security notions for end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and design the first, provably secure protocol for this widespread application.

  Analyses of multiple end-to-end encrypted cloud storage protocols revealed serious flaws, raising the question of whether any of these protocols are trustworthy. This talk will present the first cryptographic model for secure cloud storage with a compromised or malicious server, capturing real-world complexities. This model presents the first provably secure E2EE cloud storage protocol.

## Paper

This talk is based on our paper at Crypto'24, which I discuss in [this blog post](/posts/2024/08/e2ee-cloud-storage-security-notions).

## Talk Abstract

Analyses of multiple end-to-end encrypted cloud storage protocols revealed serious flaws, raising the question of whether any of these protocols are trustworthy. This talk presents the first cryptographic model for secure cloud storage with a compromised or malicious server, capturing real-world complexities. This model presents the first provably secure E2EE cloud storage protocol.
