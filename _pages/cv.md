## Research Interests
My research interests are in the intersection of applied cryptography, system security, and privacy. I am excited about using mathematical techniques for cryptanalysis. Attacks contribute to identify the root causes for failures of cryptography in practice, which can then inform the design or improvement of systems to address these issues.

## Education

- MSc ETH Zurich &ndash; EPF Lausanne in Computer Science Major in Cyber Security (short: MSc ETH EPF CS)
- BSc ETH Zurich in Computer Science (short: BSc ETH CS)

Ongoing:

- PhD at UCSD advised by [Nadia Heninger](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~nadiah/) (Fall 2022 - today)
