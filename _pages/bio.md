Miro Haller is a PhD student at UC San Diego, advised by Nadia Heninger, and works on applied cryptography and system security. He is using mathematical techniques for cryptanalysis and then leverages these attacks to identify the root causes of cryptography failures in practice and build or improve systems to address these failures. His recent work includes finding attacks on MEGA—a provider of end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) cloud storage for over 300 million users—and using insights from this analysis to build rigorous security notions for E2EE cloud storage. Moreover, Miro worked on breaking the RADIUS protocol, which is used for authentication and authorization in almost every router and VPN sold in the last twenty years.
