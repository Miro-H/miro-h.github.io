WAC is an affiliated event with Crypto that gives a platform to the most exiting cryptanalytic attacks of the year.

## Workshop description

Cryptography is often thought of as the bright spot of practical security, a mathematical paradise where security can be rigorously proven and issues like buffer overflows are in someone elseâ€™s department.
However, there is a growing community of researchers who regularly find serious flaws in widely deployed cryptographic implementations and protocols.
In recent years, this type of research has mostly been published in systems security conferences.
This workshop will bring together researchers who work on cryptographic attacks and provide a showcase of their work for the Crypto community.
This is the seventh edition of the WAC workshop, which was established by Nadia Heninger.
