CAW is an affiliated event with Eurocrypt that focuses on the construction and analysis of cryptography built for practice.

## Workshop description

The Cryptographic Applications Workshop (CAW; the constructive twin of [WAC](/posts/2024/08/wac)) focuses on the construction and analysis of cryptography built for practice.
Inspired by the Real World Crypto Symposium, it aims to provide a forum for cryptographers in academia and industry to exchange ideas and insights, bridging the gap between research and real-world applications. The main themes of CAW are
1. formalizing the security of deployed cryptography,
2. constructing cryptographic primitives and systems for practice, and
3. the industry perspective on deployment and maintenance of cryptography.

The workshop consisted of a mixture of invited and contributed talks on recent contributions and developments in the field of applied cryptography.
