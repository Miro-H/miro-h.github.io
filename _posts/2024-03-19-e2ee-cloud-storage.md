## Abstract

> End-to-end encryption is rapidly becoming the accepted security goal for personal data. In this article, we examine consumer cloud storage systems, focusing in particular on those systems that attempt to provide end-to-end security for customer data. We survey the security guarantees of current service providers and the issues they face, discuss open research questions, and highlight the challenges that impede the deployment of end-to-end secure cloud storage.
