# ECSC Prague 2021

The European Cyber Security Challenge 2021 in Prague is over! This is a yearly reoccuring event with around 20 (mostly) European countries. Every year, a different state hosts the onsite CTF competition. This year, we had two competition days with over 50 challenges in the categories crypto, reversing, web, forensics, misc, and hardware. Furthermore, there was an escape room and international team challenges.

As the coach of the Swiss team, I am proud of their performance. We finished on the 11th place against outstanding competitors. The field was very close together which can be seen from the fact that we were on the 4th place six hours before the end of the competition.
